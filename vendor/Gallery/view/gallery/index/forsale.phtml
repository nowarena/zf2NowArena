<h1>SlimAndBusty.com for sale</h1>


<p>SlimAndBusty.com is currently integrated with Tumblr, Instagram and
	Twitter, however, the sale price is based only on the domain name and
	the code.</p>
<p>For example, if you don't want the SlimAndBusty Instagram account,
	that does not lower the sale price.</p>
<p>You should never have to look under the hood, but here are a few
	details about the code.
<ul>
	<li>Backend is <a href='http://php.net' target='_blank'>php</a>/<a
		href='http://mysql.com' target='_blank'>mysql</a> <a
		href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zend_Framework' target='_blank'>Zend
			Framework 2</a>.
	</li>
	<li>The front end makes extensive use of <a href='http://jquery.com'
		target='_blank'>jquery</a> to achieve a <a
		href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design'
		target='_blank'>responsive web design</a>.
	</li>
	<li>The site is hosted by LunarPages.com, and I've been with them about
		seven years and have had no problems that weren't remedied quickly.
		Because I host no content and made use of Zend Framework's caching,
		I'm able to use their basic plan at $4.95 a month.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The source of revenue you generate comes from being integrated with
	camgirls from <a
		href='http://jmp.awempire.com/?siteId=awe&pageName=home&params[referral_rs]=bustyshots'
		target='_blank'>AweEmpire</a>. I've been with them for about four
	years now and have had zero problems. All they do is send me a check.
</p>
<p>This is a turn key solution: I give you usernames and passwords and
	you get total access to all site features, code, database, etc.</p>
<p>It's all yours with one condition: you do not resell the code.</p>
<p>Your job is simply to generate content!
<ul>
	<li>'Favorite' pics on <a href='http://twitter.com/slimandbusty'
		target='_blank'>Twitter</a></li>
	<li>'Heart' pics on <a href='http://instagram.com/slimandbusty'
		target='_blank'>Instagram</a> (Nothing really to see there because of
		the way Instagram works).
	</li>
	<li>Post pics or reblog pics on <a
		href='http://bustyandslim.tumblr.com' target='_blank'>Tumblr</a></li>
	<li>Generate traffic via the subreddit <a
		href='http://www.reddit.com/r/slimandbusty' target='_blank'>SlimAndBusty</a></li>
	<li>Set AweEmpire's camgirls as 'ass' or 'boob' models and disapprove
		the rest. (This is done using the site's admin page. See below.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	You can literarlly generate the content from a bar stool using a tablet
	or smart phone. I've only just begun to explore what could be developed
	using all the social media. The SlimAndBusty <a
		href='http://www.reddit.com/r/slimandbusty' target='_blank'>subreddit</a>
	actually generated some nice traffic, but my interest lies more in the
	coding.
</p>
<p>
	If you develop all aspects of SlimAndBusty (keywords on Tumblr, post to
	the SlimAndBusty subreddit on reddit, make friends on twitter, etc.), I
	strongly suspect you'll make more money than me. <br> BUT I've been
	running the site for a while, so there are a few things you should be
	aware of. You have to be sure to follow the rules of the social media
	sites. I used to have <a href='http://slimandbusty.tumblr.com'
		target='_blank'>slimandbusty.tumblr.com</a>, but I got over zealous in
	posting professional/glamour pics and got nailed with so many copyright
	notices, they shut it down. 
</p>
<p>Fortunately, I'm back with almost 30,000 followers on my BustyAndSlim
	Tumblr.</p>

<p>Currently, I emphasize reblogging on my new BustyAndSlim tumblr and avoid
	posting professional looking model shots. Note, I am not responsible in
	anyway for how any social site treats you. If you follow all of this to
	the letter, you may still have problems. Having said that, I haven't received any more
	warnings from Tumblr since I implemented my new strategy.</p>

As long as you stay on top of it, it's managable. (Clear out the queue
every third day. Try to do it every day).

	Sometimes a camgirl gets approved that shouldn't have, and you can <b>manage

	to go into the admin page.<br> <img
